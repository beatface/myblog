        <!-- <h2>About</h2> -->
        <p>It is no wonder that someone from the very edge of the North American continent would possess a voice as naturally captivating as the verdant Pacific Northwest. Emma Beaton, young cellist and singer from Qualicum Beach, British Columbia has what bluegrass super-star Laurie Lewis called, a "voice like a laser," clear, effortless, and striking to the core.</p>
        <p>The child of two Scottish emigrants, Beaton is no stranger to the traditional music realm. She learned to play the cello amongst seas of fiddlers at Alasdair Fraser's San Francisco Scottish Fiddlers and under Natalie Haas at Berklee College of Music.</p>
        <p>Beaton’s voice has been heard in every corner of the globe, after years of touring full-time with the progressive stringband outfit, Joy Kills Sorrow. Described as "a fiery-haired, charismatic and intensely evocative singer with soul way beyond her years,” by Connect Savannah, and “captivating” by NPR’s Mountain Stage, she’s appeared on PBS, NPR’s Mountain Stage and A Prairie Home Companion, STV (Scottish Television), and more.</p>
        <p>At the age of eighteen, Beaton won the Canadian Folk Music Award's Young Performer of the Year after the release of her debut recording, "Pretty Fair Maid." Two years later, she was nominated for Traditional Vocalist of the Year for her self-titled debut record with Nic Gareiss. With Joy Kills Sorrow, she recorded two full-length albums and an EP, all released on Signature Sounds Recordings and met with critical acclaim.</p>
